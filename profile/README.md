### Hey! 👋

Welcome to **Cgql**, a framework for the powerful GraphQL in the mighty C++

GraphQL is a such a powerful thing that if it is implemented right... we can go way
far with it. Cgql focuses on speed and ease of use. 

#### Overview of repositories
- [cgql/cgql](https://github.com/cgql/cgql) - Open source repository of Cgql containing its source code
- [cgql/cgql-docs](https://github.com/cgql/cgql-docs) - Documentation website for Cgql

###### Is it production ready? No! Well it's very fast, it can parse the github schema within `9ms` but still it needs some tuning
